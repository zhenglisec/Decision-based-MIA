# Decision-based Membership Inference Attacks

This repository contains the implementation for "Membership Leakage in Label-Only Exposures" (ACM CCS 2021)

Code will come soon.

Our algorithm is also already available on [Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)](https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/attacks/inference/membership_inference.html#membership-inference-label-only-decision-boundary) which are two popular Python packages to craft adversarial examples for machine learning models.
